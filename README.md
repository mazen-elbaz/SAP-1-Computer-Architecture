# 🧠 SAP-1 Computer Architecture Project

A simplified 8-bit computer architecture implementation (SAP-1) completed as a final project for the Computer Architecture course at Zewail City.

## 🧩 Components Implemented
- Program Counter (PC)
- Memory (RAM)
- Instruction Register (IR)
- Control Unit (CU)
- ALU (Adder only)
- B Register & Accumulator
- Output Register

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Logisim** – Digital circuit simulation
- Screenshots/images of circuit

## 🎯 What I Learned
- CPU microarchitecture and control sequencing
- Clock cycles, instruction execution, timing
- Designing and simulating a working SAP-1 CPU
- Binary instruction encoding & microinstructions

## 🏫 Course Context
Built as part of the **Computer Architecture** course in my first year at Zewail City.
